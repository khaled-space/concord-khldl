To get started, look at the Burst matching tutorial notebook

A work in progress

### What is this repository for? ###

* Reading in and plotting thermonuclear burst data and models, and performing model-observation comparisons
* Version 0.1

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the repository and import burst class.py
* Check the Burst matching tutorial notebook for demonstrations of usage
* See burstclass.py for dependencies
* You'll also need to download some reference bursts from http://burst.sci.monash.edu/reference, and some model bursts from http://burst.sci.monash.edu/kepler. Or, you can define routines to read in your own data

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines
